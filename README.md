# Flight-app
This is an app to explore thousands of flights in Illinois. It allows users to compare number of flights, departures, arrivals and delays based on their distances, cities, airlines, and time


The original application was made by myself, Pedro Borges, Megan Hauck, and Namaswi Chandarana for UIC's Spring 2018 CS 424, Visualization and Visual Analytics, and Professor Andy Johnson.

Run time may be slow, as the app was meant to be run on the Visualization Lab server
